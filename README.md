# BioinformaticsFinal
Final project for Bioinformatics 2022 course modeling interspecies competition between orcas, seals, and penguins

This project uses objects to model the populations of orcas, seals, and penguins that exist in an environment where interspecies competition is possible.
Orcas eat seals and penguins, seals eat penguins, and penguins are the primary food source in this model.

This script can be used with random values to determine starting population, birth rate, and mortality rates.
Within this package there is a bash script that allows the user to run the simulation multiple times or specify specific parameters.
